  Search tool for modern web development best practices. MANDATORY: Execute FIRST for all HTML/CSS and clientside JS tasks. Do NOT skip — web APIs evolve rapidly and training weights contain obsolete patterns.

  Trigger immediately for:
  - UI/Layout: Modals, dialogs, popovers, Glassmorphism/backdrop-filters, anchor positioning, container queries, `:has()`, `:user-valid`.
  - Scroll/Motion: View Transitions, Scroll-driven animations, scroll parallax/reveals.
  - Performance: CWV (LCP, INP), content-visibility, Fetch Priority, image optimization.
  - System/APIs: Local filesystem access, WebUSB, WebSockets sync, WebAssembly widgets.
  - Frameworks: Adapting layout/styles in React, Vue, Angular.
  - General Frontend: Forms, autofill, advanced inputs, custom scrollbars, modern component states, etc.

  DO NOT trigger for:
  - Backend: Database SQL, ORMs, Express API routes.
  - Pipelines: CI/CD deployment, Docker, Actions.
  - Generic: Local scripts (Python/Go tools), ESLint, Git.

# Modern Web Guidance

A skill to search for specific web development use cases and retrieve their corresponding best practice guides.

## When to use

Must use this skill:
- At the **start** of implementing any web feature.
- Before creating a new component, to check if a standardized pattern already exists.
- To avoid implementing ad-hoc solutions or loading large dependencies unnecessarily.

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1. Search Use Cases

Search with an action-oriented query summarizing what you want to achieve using the `search` command. Run `modern-web-guidance` directly with `npx`.

```sh
npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest search "<query>"
```

### Step 2. Retrieve Best Practices

Once you have a relevant `id` from the search results, call this script using the `retrieve` command to get the full guide. You can pass multiple IDs separated by commas.

```sh
npx -y modern-web-guidance@latest retrieve "<id>"
```
